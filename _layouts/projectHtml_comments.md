## Next Steps Critique

- Accessibility: Consider adding ARIA roles (e.g., `role='main'`) for better accessibility.
- SEO: Add meta tags (e.g., Open Graph, Twitter cards) for individual projects if needed.
- Gallery: Ensure `gallery.html` handles missing or empty `slug` gracefully.
- Benefits: If benefits can be long, consider supporting Markdown inside `<li>` for formatting.
- Styling: Ensure consistent styling between gallery, content, and benefits sections.
- Error handling: Consider a default message if no content or gallery exists.
