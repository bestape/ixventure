# Line-by-Line Critique of `version.json`

This file provides a line-by-line review of the `version.json` file in the Jekyll repo, modeled after the style of the example at [myfmv.ai/prompts/13](https://myfmv.ai/prompts/13).

## Lines 1‑3: Front Matter

```liquid
---
layout: null
permalink: /version.json
---
```

**What it does:**  
- Declares YAML front matter for Jekyll.  
- `layout: null` ensures no layout is applied (important for JSON).  
- `permalink: /version.json` makes the output accessible at `/version.json`.

**Strengths:**  
- Correctly disables layouts to avoid wrapping JSON in HTML.  
- Explicit permalink ensures predictable URL.

**Potential Issues / Risks:**  
- If layouts are applied by mistake (e.g., via config), the JSON output could break.  
- Missing `content-type` enforcement (depends on server).

**Suggestions:**  
- Ensure the web server sets `Content-Type: application/json`.  
- Consider using `json` layout if one exists in the repo (though `null` is safer here).

## Lines 4‑6: JSON Body

```json
{
  "build": "{{ site.time | date: '%s' }}"
}
```

**What it does:**  
- Creates a JSON object with a single property: `build`.  
- Uses Jekyll’s `site.time` variable with Unix timestamp format (`%s`).  
- The output will look like:  
  ```json
  { "build": "1737164823" }
  ```

**Strengths:**  
- Provides a unique build identifier for cache busting.  
- Simple and minimal.  
- Useful for debugging deployments.

**Weaknesses:**  
- `site.time` is the build time, not commit time. It changes with every build, even if nothing changed.  
- Could create unnecessary cache churn in CDNs or client apps.  
- Always outputs as a string, not a number.

**Suggestions:**  
- Consider using Git commit hash instead of `site.time` for better traceability.  
- If numeric output is desired, drop the quotes around `{{ site.time | date: '%s' }}`.  
- Add more metadata (e.g., version, environment, commit SHA). Example:  
  ```json
  {
    "build": "{{ site.time | date: '%s' }}",
    "commit": "{{ site.github.build_revision }}",
    "env": "{{ jekyll.environment }}"
  }
  ```

## General Observations

- File is functional as-is but minimal.  
- Good practice for cache busting or client‑side “is site updated?” checks.  
- Fragile if external systems rely solely on timestamp for versioning.  
- Lack of schema or multiple fields may limit usefulness for CI/CD pipelines.

---

## Suggested Improvements

1. Add commit SHA and environment info.  
2. Decide whether `build` should be string or integer.  
3. Consider JSON schema or more descriptive fields.  
4. Ensure correct `Content-Type` header is served.  
5. Document its purpose for maintainers.
