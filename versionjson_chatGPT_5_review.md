# Line-by-Line Review of `version.json`

**Commit reviewed:** `8b4d41f5e3201e783662842acf683c7483529fb0`

---

## 1. Purpose

- `version.json` is a lightweight metadata file intended to store version information about the site or project.
- It helps both developers and automated tools quickly check what build or release is deployed.

---

## 2. File Structure

```json
---
layout: null
permalink: /version.json
---
{
  "build": "{{ site.time | date_to_xmlschema }}"
}
```

- JSON format ensures easy parsing by scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or browsers.
- Likely fields:
  - `version`: The semantic or incremental version of the site (`1.0.0`, etc.).
  - `build`: Identifier for a specific build or commit.
  - `date`: Deployment or build timestamp.

---

## 3. Integration Notes

- This file is static and can be served directly by GitHub Pages or Netlify.
- It can be fetched via JS (`fetch('/version.json')`) to display version info in the UI.
- Helpful for debugging cache invalidation issues, since the number changes per build.

---

## 4. Suggestions

- Ensure semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) if the project evolves regularly.
- Add a `commit` or `sha` field to map deployments to Git history more clearly.
- Include a `lastUpdated` field (ISO 8601 timestamp) for precise deployment tracking.
