## What are We Obsessed With?

Continuing the inventor-class lawyer traditions of **juris doctor linguists** who have hyperdeflated legal costs worldwide:

* **Goldfarb**, the Internet's grandpa by inventing **Markup Language** _digital legal formalization_
  
* **Szabo**, the Blockchain's grandpa by inventing **Smart-Contract Language** _digital legal formalization_

Note that the Internet and the Blockchain are both legal expressions. They are a Commons of real-world relationships formalized through XML, Solidity, etc.

## Why are We Obsessed With It?

Legal is hyperinflationary _and_ scarce nowadays: 

* But a world that enjoys legal abundance is **a humanitarian world filled with peace & joy**. (As we now enjoy with transport abundance compared to the scarcity of 200 years ago).

* **Sovtech** reinforces our rights to _sovereignty_ along the entire **individual → multistate** vertical, because a break anywhere along the vertical can lead to catastrophe!
