## IxVentureâ€™s Position on DOM iFrames

IxVenture is investing in multiple recursive (iFrame) **Document Object Model (DOM) formats** because we believe DOMs represent the **next stage after digital-analog legal formalization**.

By supporting the development of **multiple legally meaningful DOM formats**, IxVenture is building toward a world where organizational and contractual logic can be expressed as interoperable objects.

Many of the DOM stacks we're building uses the Hierarchical Script-Database "**SeedTree**" kernel-not-framework solution invented by IxVenture co-founder, bestape.

From this object orientation, we believe very much that iFrames should be expressed as NFT interdata objects.
