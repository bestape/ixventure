## IxVenture’s Position on DOMs

IxVenture is investing in multiple **Distributed Organizational Models (DOMs)** because we believe DOMs represent the **next stage after digital-analog legal formalization**.

Where oral, print, and digital-analog systems defined earlier eras of record-keeping and governance, DOMs introduce a programmable, verifiable layer that extends organizational logic into distributed infrastructures.  

## DOM Categories

### GitHub-Hosted DOMs
- **No Framework** – e.g. [research.lex.clinic](https://research.lex.clinic)  
- **Jekyll Framework** – e.g. [ixventure.studio](https://ixventure.studio)  

### Raspberry Pi-Hosted DOMs
- **SeedTree Kernel** – e.g. [github.com/cheerbotme](https://github.com/cheerbotme)  

### NFT Platform-Hosted DOMs
- **iNFTs** – [Ape Mirror article](https://ape.mirror.xyz/FjUVEcUrDmQISEmcVarGEDHt6mLK9VOjLbxXgFy4edE)  
- **uxNFTs** – [ERC-7827 proposal](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7827-json-smart-contract-with-value-version-control/21865)

## Why This Matters
By investing across **multiple DOM formats**, IxVenture is positioning itself at the frontier of organizational innovation.  

Each hosting model reflects a different pathway for formalization, but together they represent the **fourth stage** in the evolution of legal and organizational systems.
