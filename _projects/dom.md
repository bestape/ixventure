## IxVenture’s Position on DOMs

IxVenture is investing in multiple **Document Object Model (DOM) formats** because we believe DOMs represent the **next stage after digital-analog legal formalization**.

The historical progression has been:  

1. **Oral** – agreements spoken and remembered
2. **Print** – agreements codified on paper
3. **Digital-Analog** – agreements stored as digital files but still interpreted by analog legal systems
4. **DOM** – agreements expressed as structured, machine-readable objects

DOMs move organizational and legal logic into programmable structures, making them transparent, verifiable, and extensible across platforms.

## DOM Categories

### GitHub-Hosted DOMs
- **No Framework** – e.g. [research.lex.clinic](https://research.lex.clinic)  
- **Jekyll Framework** – e.g. [ixventure.studio](https://ixventure.studio)  

### Raspberry Pi-Hosted DOMs
- **SeedTree Kernel** – e.g. [github.com/cheerbotme](https://github.com/cheerbotme)  

### NFT Platform-Hosted DOMs
- **iNFTs** – some info at [Ape Mirror article](https://ape.mirror.xyz/FjUVEcUrDmQISEmcVarGEDHt6mLK9VOjLbxXgFy4edE)  
- **uxNFTs** – some info at [ERC-7827 proposal](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7827-json-smart-contract-with-value-version-control/21865)  

## Why This Matters
By supporting **multiple DOM formats**, IxVenture is building toward a world where organizational and contractual logic can be expressed as interoperable objects.

This step — from digital-analog to DOM — represents the **fourth stage** in the evolution of legal and organizational systems.
