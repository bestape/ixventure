## IxVenture’s Position on DOMs

IxVenture is investing in multiple **Document Object Model (DOM) formats** because we believe DOMs represent the **next stage after digital-analog legal formalization**.

The historical progression has been:  

1. **Oral** – agreements spoken and remembered
2. **Papyrus** – agreements codified on paper
3. **Print** – agreements widely disseminated
4. **Digital-Print** – agreements stored as digital files but still interpreted by analog legal systems
5. **Digital-DOM** – agreements expressed as structured, machine-readable objects

DOMs shift organizational and legal logic into programmable structures, making them transparent, verifiable, and extensible across platforms. Unlike past approaches that relied on occasional snapshots, DOMs treat legal formalization as a continuous stream of events with ongoing recording and accountability.

## DOM Categories

### GitHub-Hosted DOMs
- **No Framework** – e.g. [research.lex.clinic](https://research.lex.clinic)  
- **Jekyll Framework** – e.g. [ixventure.studio](https://ixventure.studio)  

### Raspberry Pi-Hosted DOMs
- **SeedTree Kernel** – e.g. [github.com/cheerbotme](https://github.com/cheerbotme)  

### NFT Platform-Hosted DOMs
- **iNFTs** – some info at [Ape Mirror article](https://ape.mirror.xyz/FjUVEcUrDmQISEmcVarGEDHt6mLK9VOjLbxXgFy4edE)  
- **uxNFTs** – some info at [ERC-7827 proposal](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7827-json-smart-contract-with-value-version-control/21865)  

## Why This Matters
By supporting **multiple DOM formats**, IxVenture is building toward a world where organizational and contractual logic can be expressed as interoperable objects.
