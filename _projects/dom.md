## DOM as a Digital Legal Formalism Object

At IxVentures, we treat **DOMs (Document Object Models)** not just as technical blueprints, but as a **fundamental digital legal formalism object**.  
A DOM provides the structural backbone that determines how information is organized, validated, and interpreted — much like a contract sets the rules for interaction in law.  
By encoding structure, order, and rules, DOMs become the bridge between **machine readability** and **human accountability**.

This perspective lets DOMs serve as:

- **Technical infrastructure** — the programmatic layer that browsers, frameworks, and servers rely on.  
- **Legal-formal artifacts** — structured objects that define obligations, rights, and traceability in digital systems.  

### IxVentures DOM Architectures

IxVentures is actively investing in **multiple DOM architectures**, each tailored for different applications and compliance contexts.  
Some emphasize lightweight rendering and flexibility, while others embed auditability, persistence, or traceable governance rules.

## GitHub-Hosted DOM Architecture

The architecture documented here belongs to the **GitHub-hosted DOM category**.  
It is powered by the **Jekyll framework**, which transforms structured markdown and configuration files into a static yet formalized digital object.  

- **Framework:** Jekyll (open-source static site generator)  
- **Category:** GitHub-hosted DOM  
- **Purpose:** Provide a transparent, reproducible, and formally structured publication pipeline for project documentation, reviews, and mappings  

### Strengths of the Jekyll Framework

- **Simplicity**: Content is expressed in markdown and configuration files, minimizing technical overhead.  
- **Reproducibility**: Any commit of the repository can be rebuilt deterministically into the same DOM.  
- **Transparency**: Source files and generated artifacts are visible in GitHub, ensuring traceability.  
- **Community Support**: A mature ecosystem with plugins, themes, and hosting integrations (e.g., GitHub Pages).  

### Limitations of This Architecture

- **Indirect Generation**: The DOM is **not directly the repository** itself, but rather a transformation.  
  - The Jekyll build process interprets markdown, YAML, and includes to generate static HTML.  
  - This introduces a separation between the **canonical source repo** and the **rendered DOM artifact**.  
- **Loss of Fidelity**: Some structures (like comments, unrendered files, or alternative branches) are not fully represented in the published DOM.  
- **Build Dependency**: The DOM’s validity depends on the Jekyll engine and its configurations, which means the DOM can drift if the framework changes.
