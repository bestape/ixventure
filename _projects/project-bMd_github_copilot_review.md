# project-b.md Explanation

## Front Matter (YAML)

```yaml
---
title: Project B
slug: project-b
layout: project
description: This is where the project description should go!
---
```

- `title: Project B` → The human-readable title of the page.  
- `slug: project-b` → The short name / identifier used in URLs and includes (e.g. `/projects/project-b`).  
- `layout: project` → Tells Jekyll which layout template to use (likely `project.html`).  
- `description:` → Short meta description for SEO and preview text.  

This block defines metadata that Jekyll will use when rendering the page.

# Critiques & Next Steps for project-b.md

## Critiques
- **Generic description**: The placeholder text (“Cras sit amet…”) doesn’t tell the reader anything meaningful about the project.  
- **Benefits list is vague**: “Benefit 1 / 2 / 3” should be replaced with real, specific advantages of the project.  
- **No media or visuals**: There are no screenshots, diagrams, or links to demonstrate the project.  
- **SEO could be stronger**: The `description` metadata is generic and not optimized for search or sharing.  

## Suggested Next Steps (v0.2)
1. Replace placeholder text with an actual project summary (what it does, who it’s for, why it matters).  
2. Expand the benefits list with concrete, specific points.  
3. Add optional visuals (e.g., an image tag, diagram, or screenshot).  
4. Improve the `description` in the front matter to make it SEO-friendly.  
5. Consider linking to related projects or external resources.
